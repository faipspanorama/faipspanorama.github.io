			<p>We all know that this pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. But frontline workers such as doctors, medical specialists and other healthcare support providers are working full time, away from their families. It has been a very tough time for them both physically and mentally. They are responding to this onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic with professionalism and courage.</p>

			

			<p>I feel proud to discuss with Dr Sarah Khan her experiences as a frontline worker. Dr Sarah Khan is an alumni of FAIPS, Kuwait who is taking care of Covid-19  patients  at  Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Hospital, Ahmedabad, Gujarat. </p>

			<p>Riddhima : What motivated you to join the Covid 19 team of doctors?</p>

			<p>Dr Sarah Khan : As a doctor, I got a wonderful opportunity to serve my nation. When I had taken the Hippocratic Oath, I had promised myself to give my best in any situation. Due to a surge in the number of cases, there are not enough healthcare workers. The disease which is caused due to a new strain of coronavirus has a limited treatment approach and the medicines are still under research. So it is important to attend to the symptomatic relief and mental support of the patients. </p>

			<p>Riddhima : What are the duties you have to perform ?</p>

			<p>Dr Sarah Khan : Apart from diagnosing and treating patients in a daily OPD, I am a part of the epidemiological surveillance, taking nasopharyngeal swabs for sample and diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases, as well as active COVID-19 case and contact tracing which is an important part of understanding and controlling an outbreak. </p>

			<p>Riddhima : How is a typical day now different from before the virus outbreak?</p>

			<p>Dr Sarah Khan : It is indeed a different scenario than what it used to be before. A seasonal flu and common cold were not considered an emergency earlier and didn’t affect peoples’ daily lives. But now, due to high infectivity of the novel coronavirus and greater mortality, people are at a greater risk especially those with co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension etc.  There are stricter rules for personal protection so as to curb the spread like working in PPEs all day for healthcare professionals.</p>

			<p>Riddhima : How is your family supporting your work now?</p>

			<p>Dr Sarah Khan : My parents and younger sister have been very supportive. They have guided me from day one and they understand the importance of duty. Their motivation has kept me upstream. However, they also remain concerned about my safety. But I have assured them that I take full protective measures. </p>

		<p>Riddhima : What has been the one good thing that you’ve noticed during this outbreak?</p>

	<p>Dr Sarah Khan : Well the pandemic has affected peoples’ health drastically. But it has also caused an increase in awareness. The healthcare sector has gained more importance and there has been an increase in the strengthening of the same by the government. There has been an improvement in the health of flora and fauna and a decrease in pollution globally. Also, due to social distancing, people are able to spend quality time with their family which is creating a positive environment.</p>

	<p>Riddhima : Can you tell us what are some of the measures that are in place for your department now?</p>

	<p>Dr Sarah Khan : We strictly follow WHO’s guidelines and measures. It is known that prevention is better than cure. Wearing personal protective measures and face masks, following social distancing of at least 1 meter, implementing the proper handwashing technique as given by WHO for at least 20 seconds and using an alcohol based hand sanitizer, disinfecting the place on a regular basis are some of the necessary measures followed.</p>

	<p>Riddhima : Any advice to the FAIPS fraternity on how to stay positive at this dire time?</p>

	<p>Dr Sarah Khan : I would suggest everyone to stay calm and composed. It is a difficult time but if everyone stays united, this time too shall pass. Compliance is very important so following the guidelines and measures provided by an official healthcare authority is the key. Completely avoid unknown sources which spread unnecessary panic and fake information. Try out new hobbies like cooking, reading etc. for which you didn’t have time for before.  Also, exercise daily for at least 30 minutes. Eat healthy so as to keep one’s immunity strong. This pandemic has affected the mental health as well so providing emotional comfort, motivation and assurance to each other will keep up the positivity level! </p>
