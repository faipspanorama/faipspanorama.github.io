			<p>In a small, poor city, everyone is in debt and lives on borrowing. One day, a rich tourist comes to the city, enters the hotel and puts $ 100 under the account to go check and choose a suitable room; And in this period:</p>

			<p>The hotel owner takes the opportunity, takes $ 100 and goes to the butcher to pay off his debt.The butcher rejoices with these dollars and rushes the cattle merchant to pay off his debt.</p>

			<p>- The cattle dealer takes 100 dollars and rushes to the feed dealer to pay off his debt.</p>

			<p>- The feed dealer goes to the truck driver, who brought the feed from his country far, to pay back his late dues.</p>

			<p>- The truck driver runs quickly to the Sunrise Hotel, from which he rents a room on debt when he is present to hand the fodder to rest from the hassle of traveling, and gives the hotel owner $ 100 to pay off his debts.</p>

			<p>- The owner of the hotel returns and puts the hundred dollars in place, before the rich tourist descends from his inspection tour.</p>

			<p>The rich tourist, who did not like the level of the rooms, goes down and decides to take the hundred dollars and leave the city!!! </p>

			<p>In the end, none of the city's residents earned anything but they paid all their debts.</p>

			<p>This is how the worldâ€™s economics are managed!!!</p>
