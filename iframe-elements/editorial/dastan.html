			<p>A room of full of Indians and a dull atmosphere are phrases that can never be put together. Playing a superhit Bollywood number from the ’90s is enough to cheer up the atmosphere and get the people on the dance floor because as Indians, our favourite song playing is a reason enough to make the spot we are present at as the dance floor. So, the common factor that unites us all is our love for BOLLYWOOD. For an outsider, Bollywood might just sound like any other film producing industry. But, for us Bollywood holds special meaning- it brings with it a plethora of emotions. Right from happiness, sadness and anger to guilt, comedy and love, Bollywood is our rallying point.</p>

			<p>The year 2020 hasn’t been great for Bollywood so far. This year brought with it many trials and tribulations. Unfortunately, some of the most loved heroes of our industry failed to overcome these trying times. This year, we lost a few of our most prominent, renowned and talented actors of the movie world. Their films are an embodiment of emotions that will stay in our hearts forever. Rishi Kapoor, Irfan Khan and Sushant Singh Rajput, three beautiful human beings, three era’s and three superstars have today become one with the stars and we will never be able to make up for this loss. Although they have left us, something that will remain with us and our posterity is their art. Art that has manifested itself in the form of various characters, dialogues and musical numbers on the screen, Art that is immortal.</p>

			<p>Rishi Kapoor, third-generation heir of the Kapoor clan breathed his last on the 30th of April 2020. His death has robbed the showbiz of a seasoned entertainer. With films across varied genres, he proved exactly what a versatile actor comprises of. With movies like Karz (1980), Bobby (1973), Amar Akbar Anthony (1977) and Kapoor and Sons (2016), Rishi Kapoor had the time and again proved his mettle as an artist. </p>

			<p>Irfan Khan lost his battle to neuroendocrine cancer on the 29th of April 2020. Irfan's presence on screen wasn’t governed by dramatic monologues and larger than life roles, it was his simplicity his warm, deep eyes and infectious cheeky smile. In the words of his co-star Angelina Jolie, Khan will be remembered for his “unparalleled commitment” to his art. With fine works like Haasil (2003), Paan Singh Tomar (2012), The Lunchbox (2013), Hindi Medium (2017) and Slumdog Millionaire (2008) he was unparalleled in his craft</p>

			<p>The final blow came with the passing away of Sushant Singh Rajput on the 14th of June 2020. Rajput’s life was in many ways a dream come true- a middle-class boy from Bihar, an engineering dropout, who started as a background dancer and eventually made it to the big screen. He was first seen as Manav in the hit soap Pavitra Rishta(2009-11), a role that instantly connected him with the masses. While many of his colleagues have failed to make the tough transition from television to cinema, Rajput did it effortlessly. His legacy lives on in movies like Kai Po Che! (2013), Sonchiriya (2019) and M.S. Dhoni The Untold Story (2016). His work was beyond what words can describe. He gave us a forever within a limited number of days and for that, we shall forever be grateful. </p>

			<p>Though they aren’t present with us anymore, their craft shall continue to dwell in our hearts forever.</p>
