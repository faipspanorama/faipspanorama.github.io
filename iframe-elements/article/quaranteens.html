			<p>An article on the effects of lockdown on teenagers</p>

			

			<p>The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has dramatically altered the structure of our everyday
lives with orders of social distancing, curfews, lockdowns, and more… and this maybe our new normal
for a while to come. Life is being constrained with a constriction of
daily routines and contraction of social interactions, freedom of
movement and space. There is evidence from research suggesting
that teenagers in particular are struggling with the coronavirus crisis
as a result of social distancing measures and compulsory lockdown to
control the spread of the disease. Even brief periods of social isolation
(like temporary quarantine) carries a number of health risks for
teenagers and young adults like impaired functional skills, difficulty to
focus, remember information, manage emotions and follow directions along with lowered immunity,
poor sleep and depressive symptoms. Reports show lowest levels of life satisfaction, loneliness due to
social isolation and anxiety about the future.</p>

			<p>Teenagers have found it hard to adapt because of having to constantly spend time indoors,
without being able to go to school or spend time outdoors
with their friends. After two to three months of isolation
with parents and siblings, teenagers feel bored and
uncharacteristically irritable. Some days they feel highly
motivated like they have all the time in the world and on
other days, they think life during this time is meaningless
as they are still stuck inside. The combination of being
constantly with family and separation from friends has left
many young people feeling like they are living inside a
pressure cooker. The use of internet for education and
social media for interaction and entertainment has
increased and screen time has skyrocketed as we know.</p>

			<p>On the contrary, some teenagers have used the lockdown period to challenge themselves and
support their family. They have come to appreciate their friendships/ relationships and enjoy extra
bonding time with their family while helping at home with daily tasks. The cocktail of constraints and
boredom has become a trigger for innovation. Some teenagers have found alternate ways to stay
connected with their friends like playing games or watching movies together online, talking over the
phone and texting via social media. Staying connected in some way helps in staying mentally as well as
physically healthy during the period of isolation.</p>

			<p>‘Salutogenesis’ is a reward that comes from coping with stress and becoming more self-
sufficient by pursuing passions and hobbies which ultimately leads to a sense of accomplishment at the
end of lockdown.</p>
