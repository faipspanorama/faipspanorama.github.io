			<p>All of us have times when we are low, sad or irritated with everything happening around us. In  times like the COVID-19 pandemic, when all of us are locked up at home, when our daily life and routine is disturbed, we often blame life itself for what has happened, and wonder why this had to happen to us.</p>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/9MmxZwI.jpg" width=100%>
			<p>I too have had such times. In the late summer of 2019 I had issues with my left ankle. I couldnâ€™t walk and I was asked to stop running or dancing for the next year. For someone always excited, and moving around, I was bummed. A few days after the fracture, as I lay on my bed, feeling frustrated with everything and everyone around me, I came across a public figure, Muniba Mazari, on social media who has become my inspiration since. She is a woman I look up to; she motivates me to push the extra mile. </p>

			<p>But well who is Muniba Mazari? She was born is Baloch, Pakistan in 1987. Before she could even complete her studies, she was married off at the tender age of 18. In 2008, her husband and her were involved in a car accident. While her husband survived with very few injuries, Muniba was badly hurt, with several bones broken and her entire lower body left paralyzed. Post-surgery, she was bed ridden for two years. Added to this was the pain of a failed marriage as her husband left her due to her disability. When doctors were close to giving up, Muniba's determination and positivity even in the worst of times came into play - she strived to get better treatment, and took care of herself. After a long journey of physiotherapy, medicines, and treatments, she has now recovered enough to be on a wheelchair.</p>

			<p>12 years after the accident that changed her life, she is an independent working woman and the mother of an adopted son. She is also a motivational speaker and the national ambassador for UN Women in Pakistan. She has proved that will power can be a deal breaker even in the most trying times.  She has proved to be an epitome of strength and determination, inspiring girls all around the world to take charge of their lives.</p>

			<p>Muniba Mazari is my role model. A wonder woman.</p>

			<p>After I learned about her, I felt all my problems were so trivial. I was inspired by her grit, and I was also thankful for everything that I had but overlooked because my problems obscured my vision of life.</p>

			<p>Look around you. Count your blessing. Gratitude is very important for your mental health and strength. It is the most powerful catalyst for happiness. It makes us believe what we have is more than enough to be happy with. Of course, it is not easy to cope with isolation and staying at home for over three months, but I believe that we are not stuck at home; instead, we are safe at home. The next exam that you have might seem challenging to you, but millions of children around the world have no access to education, and so the opportunity you have to write your exam is a privilege. </p>

			<p>The issues that we face today are daunting, but if we keep going forward with determination and strength, I assure you we will see the light at the end of this tunnel!</p>
