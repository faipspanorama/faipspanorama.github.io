			<p>Ever since the coronavirus pandemic began, school, work, and other daily life have taken a standstill. Most of us are still bored out of our minds, however, some of us have found out new ways to pass time. I will share some of my experiences from being on the internet to spending quality time with family. Let’s count it down: </p>

			<p>1.Making 3D art with your family</p>

			<p>This is one thing that I wanted to do every day since I first bought a ‘make it on your own’ 3D Eiffel tower from the local bookshop. There are many sites on the internet that allows you to print the base of the 3D model. This way I have made a formula 1 car and a 1998 Mercedes.  You see when we try to make something very difficult it engages our minds completely and we lose track of time.</p>

			<p>2.Grow plants </p>

			<p>Growing plants increases your responsibility level. As in an environment such as Kuwait growing plants require loads of water to survive. This will increase your mental responsibility and helps you kill time.</p>

			<p>3.Helping mom around the house </p>

			<p>I know the feeling when your mom tells you, “wake up”,” stop being lazy”, “clean your room”. Trust me I get that so many times a day but still, I do not end up cleaning my room (shh don’t tell my mom). Although students do not like this, it has a lot of benefits because by just cleaning one’s room by themselves, they remember where their belongings are placed, and it creates a healthier and more productive environment. </p>

			<p>Now for all the internet addicts out there, YES, I thought about you too!</p>

			<p>4.Zoom meetings </p>

			<p>This one I think most of you already do, reconnecting with friends and family but have you all thought about reconnecting in a fun way by playing online games: - </p>

<p>a.Pictionary </p>

<p>There are many websites like scribble.io and drawasaurus where you can create private rooms, customize your room settings and play with anybody you as I .e.., family or friends. These games are really fun when you have a large group to play with. </p>

<p>b.Bingo</p>

<p>All right this might need a little work, but still, it is very fun to play. Most of you know that now you can win prizes in this game. This will lead to a lot of fun and create memories with family and friends. </p>
