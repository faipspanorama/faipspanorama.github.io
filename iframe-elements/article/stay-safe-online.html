			<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in schools being shut all across the world. Globally, over 1.2 billion children are out of the classroom. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and in digital platforms. Research suggests changes COVID-19 have caused might be here to stay. This means e-learning will become inevitable for learners of all ages, from the primary level to universities and colleges. </p>

			<p>The question that arises on this occasion is are we truly safe online. In short ,cyber or E- safety is defined as the act of maximising a user’s awareness of security risks to private information posted online and teaching the user self-protection from cyber crimes.</p>

			<p>As teenagers, most of us have a profile on a social networking site and many of us visit these sites every day. While social media has its own set of benefits, one of its flipside is that children(especially teenagers) often unintentionally share more online than they should. </p>

			<p>They often:</p>

			<p>•	Post photos of themselves online or use their real name on their profiles. </p>

			<p>•	Reveal their birthdates and interests </p>

                        <p>•	Post their school name and the town where they live. </p>

                        <p>This can make them easy targets for online predators. In fact, many of us have had instances of:-</p>

                        <p>•	Being contacted online by someone we didn’t know in a way that made us feel scared or uncomfortable.</p>

                        <p>•	Receiving online advertising that was inappropriate for our age. </p>

                        <p>•	Lying about our age to get access to websites. </p>

                        <p>Remember that it is impossible to completely erase from the Internet our shared photos and videos and the comments we make online. Even when we think something has been deleted, it is still stored somewhere.Posting an inappropriate photo can damage one’s reputation and cause problems years later – such as when a potential employer or college admissions officer does a background check. Sending a mean-spirited text, even as a joke, can not only be very hurtful to someone else but can also even be perceived by the other as a threat, leading to consequences.</p>

                        <p>So how do we deal with social media? Here are some basic social media etiquettes: </p>

<p>•	Be nice:- Mean behaviour is not OK.</p>

<p>•	Think twice before hitting “enter”:- What  we post can be used against us.</p>

<p>•	Follow the “WWGS” (What would grandma say):- Don’t share anything on social media that we wouldn’t want our teachers, college admission officers, future bosses-and yes grandma -to see. </p>

<p>•	Use privacy settings:- We should never share our address, email id, telephone number or school’s name with a stranger on the Internet.</p>

<p>•	Don’t “friend” strangers.</p>

<p>If things go wrong:</p>
<p>•	Talk to someone you trust- the best person to choose is your parents.</p>
<p>•	Plan for the future and change your privacy settings. </p>
<p>The Internet has become a part and parcel of our life, irrespective of whether we want it to or not. Hence we have to always keep our guard up. Always be cautious about what you do online, which sites you visit and what you share. Check the authenticity of information that comes via social media. Be smart and use the Internet wisely. </p>
