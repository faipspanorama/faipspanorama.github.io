			<p>Space Exploration refers to the physical exploration of outer space. Humans’ interest to discover the truth of their existence and the desire to explore the unknown has resulted in human space exploration.</p>

			<p>Curiosity to discover new worlds has increased the boundaries of scientific and technical limits. Physical exploration is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight. The exploration began by soviet union’s sputnik1, America’s Apollo11 Mission followed by the first human spaceflight and spacewalk and the launching of International Space Station had tremendously inspired humanity to travel beyond earth’s orbit. Various countries and their space agencies had made severe attempts to explore space. Their efforts had resulted in the development of life on earth. The products and innovations used in our daily life are results of space generated research. The benefits of outer space are that it helps to increase our knowledge about outer space. It increases our understanding of our planets, galaxies, and various other celestial bodies. It also helps to determine the origins of the universe and its vastness. It has also resulted in the advancement of technology such as weather satellites, telescopes, solar panels, space tourism, and many more. It led to the collaboration of different countries for the progression of mankind to the next level. Ultimately, space exploration will lead to the search of life supporting planets for humans because human activities have led to the extinction of many species and would put an end to their existence as well. Mankind was born on earth, but it was never meant to die here.</p>

			<p>Despite all odds, scientists with the help of space agencies are making history day by day. They broke the boundaries of space travel from man leaving earth to setting footprints on the moon. Neil Armstrong once said, “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” Space exploration has nearly no limit to how far mankind can excel with the technology. It will continue to inspire great and inquisitive minds to unlock the secrets of the cosmos and create milestones.</p>
