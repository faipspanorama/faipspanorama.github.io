			<p>The food you eat can be either the safest and most powerful form of
medicine or the slowest form of poison.” said Ann Wigmore.</p>

			
			<p>Today, the world moves with such speed that we don’t have time for
slow paced steps. We ignore what’s around us and just move with the
same speed to not lose track of what is happening in our proximity. The
fast tempo of the world around us has brought in a lot of things which we
tend to look up to as benefits. We don’t realize our use of them could be
hazardous.</p>

			<p>Today we have a lot of things that can be coined hazardous, but our
circumstances are such that we have converted our own BARE
NECESSITIES to something that might just cause the end of our already
small spanned life.</p>

			<p>Not surprisingly, the people of the recent times have just found
alternatives for the basic necessity called FOOD and shaped it in such a
manner that we have been accustomed to ignore the healthy eating
habits. It is our duty to spark in that will power in us to stop the
consumptions of such harmful products.</p>

			<p>The number of children these days who prefer eating healthy food are
unsurprisingly extremely less in number. The invention of the poison
called fast food has turned all our minds towards them with their mind-
blowing appearance and extraordinary taste. Not realizing what we see,
we are quickly attracted by the shaving cream and cardboard that
appear like cakes and mashed and ice cream.</p>

			<p>The crazy inventions we have created that harm us include burgers,
pizzas, fries, ice cream and what not.</p>

			<p>The Consumption of fast food can also cause a number of ailments such
as depression, stroke, Type II diabetes, a variety of heart diseases and
early death.</p>

			<p>Despite all of us reading, learning and writing the same statement n
number of times, we are fixed with such an intention that all of this is
completely false and fast food is healthy. Although, bookish answers our
minds to think that consumption of fast food is beneficial and is required
in the daily diet.</p>

			<p>After hearing such things, I have completely tried to avoid such kind of
food completely. Believe it or not, I felt much better. It takes your
concentration to the next level and brings you out of all types of distress.</p>

			<p>In a nutshell, we do not pay attention to what we eat; instead we pay
attention to how we feel while eating at that particular moment. Taking
into consideration the quote mentioned at the starting of this article, we
should pay attention to what we load into our body. So, eat right and be
bright.</p>
